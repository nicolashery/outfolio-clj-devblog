# Outfolio Clojure Dev Blog

This documents my process of rewriting the small web app [Outfolio](https://github.com/nicolashery/outfolio-clj) using **Clojure** and **ClojureScript**, in an effort to learn the language.

The objective is to keep track of any learnings and observations from my Clojure-beginner point-of-view.

My background is essentially JavaScript (some Python in the past), mostly frontend and some backend with Node.js. Before starting the project of rewriting Outfolio in Clojure, I had read a lot of Clojure tutorials (ex: [Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/) and [Clojure from the ground up](https://aphyr.com/tags/Clojure-from-the-ground-up)), and had done some Clojure exercises on [4Clojure](https://www.4clojure.com/).
